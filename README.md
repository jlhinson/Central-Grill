# Grill Monitor
This is a project that I am working on in my spare time as a hobby. There will be bugs. The Arduino code is designed to work with a MQTT server application that I am also woking on (Central) and expects particular commands, however it could easily be adapted to your own setup. Feel free to use this code in any way as long as it does not go against the GNU GPLv3+ license. Maybe this will be of help to someone.

- more to come soon...
